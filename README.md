# Orphanage Management System

## Overview
The **Orphanage Management System** is a web-based application designed to efficiently manage orphan details and adoption requests. It allows administrators to update and track child records and adoption details, while providing a streamlined process for users (fosters) to view and request adoptions. This system replaces the manual processes with a more time-efficient and cost-effective solution.
